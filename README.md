# Time off tracking app

Created because in my current job they told me to track my team devs time off, and Spreadsheets were not enought.

This projest was made FAST, not perfect. All PR are more than very welcome.

- daisyUI, Tailwind, PostCSS
- Typescript
- Mongoose, MongoDB
- SWR
- date-fns
- ESlint, Prettier, Husky
- GitHub, Vercel

## Development

### Prerequisite

- Yarn
- MongoDB\*

> \*You can always create a [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/es/cloud/atlas) instance

2. Install project dependencies: `yarn`
3. Run dev server: `yarn dev`
4. Enjoy!: <http://localhost:3000/>
